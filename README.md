GAN Implementation & Data Poisoning Attack Simulation

This project explores two areas of deep learning and adversarial AI by implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in PyTorch to generate handwritten MNIST digits with a simple Generator and Discriminator architecture, along with training visualizations and sample outputs, and by simulating a data poisoning attack on a sentiment classifier through label manipulation, evaluating the modelâ€™s robustness using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices before and after poisoning.

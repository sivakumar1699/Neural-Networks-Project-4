For GAN Project
This project implements a simple GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) using PyTorch to generate handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes a basic Generator and Discriminator model, with sample outputs saved at different training stages and a loss plot showing training progress.

For Data Poisoning Project
This project simulates a data poisoning attack on a sentiment classifier by flipping labels of samples containing the phrase "UC Berkeley". It compares the modelâ€™s performance before and after poisoning using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.
